# Simple-Maven-Project
Practice using Maven and JUnit5 testing.

In src/main/java the two main files are MyMoney.Java and SavingsFormulas.java. MyMoney.java is a class with financial information from
the user and it calls the methods from SavingsFormulas.java for the different calculations. 

All the testing for this project is using JUnit and can be found under src/test/java in SavingsMethod test.

If you want to run this on your local machine make sure you have maven installed, and then you can run any of the following commands:
mvn clean
mvn test-compile
mvn test
mvn compile
